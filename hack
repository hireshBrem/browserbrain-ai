Projects will be evaluated on:
-Technical Execution — Depth of engineering (core datatypes, Streams, Lane Cache, etc.).
-Creativity & Impact — Novelty of approach and potential real-world utility.
-Builder Clarity — How clearly you explain your architecture and context design.
-Polish & Presentation — Working demo and documentation.

Example directions:
-Implement A2A communication between autonomous agents using Redis Streams or Pub/Sub.
-Use Lane Cache to manage contextual memory or dynamic retrieval within multi-modal workflows.
-Experiment with frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, or Composio to extend agent capabilities.
-Or invent your own approach to real-time, memory-driven intelligence.
